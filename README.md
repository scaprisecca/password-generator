# Password Generator

This is a password generator I built using HMTL, CSS and Vanilla JS.

## Features
- Will generate a password from 6 to 50 characters
- Can include uppercase, numbers and symbols into your password to increase difficulty
- Copy your current password directly to your clipboard
- All password history is saved with a time and date stamp, click the button to view your passwords
- Password history is scrollable and has a button to close the history view.
